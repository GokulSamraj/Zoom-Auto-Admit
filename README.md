This is a chrome Extension which admits participants in the waiting room automatically

User have to import the files manually in the extension tab.

To import (or manually load) a Chrome extension from a folder, follow these steps:

Extract the extension files (if needed):

If your extension is in a ZIP or RAR file, extract it into a dedicated folder. Make sure to store this folder somewhere stable, as Chrome will run the extension directly from this location and will not copy it elsewhere.

Open the Chrome Extensions page:

Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/ using the address bar.

Enable Developer Mode:

In the upper right corner of the Extensions page, toggle the switch labeled Developer mode to turn it on.

Load the unpacked extension:

Click the Load unpacked button that appears.

In the dialog box, navigate to and select the folder containing the extensionâ€™s extracted files, then click Select Folder (Windows) or Open (Mac).

Verify installation:

The extension should now appear in your extensions list and its icon (if it has one) will appear in the browser toolbar.
